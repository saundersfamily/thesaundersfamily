      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>We are a family of 5 plus one dog. Sheila and I are the parents who met at a payphone. Ask one of us the full story about our first meeting and be prepared to laugh...mostly at me (Anthony). Our life is spent at ball fields and tracks across the country. You can see a <a href="extracurriculars.html">map</a> of all the states that we have visited for one sport or another on the extracurriculars page. We do other stuff but none of it is as fun as watching our kids compete in their respective sports.</p>

      <h3>Anthony</h3>
      <p>I am the old man and captain of this ship. I am techie at heart and love to learn new stuff on my computer. As an example, this website was born when I decided I wanted to learn about the CSS Grid (website nerd language) when we were ordered to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic. I also like to read books by Vince Flynn, Lee Child and Brad Thor. Finally, I do skills videos for athletes to send to coaches as part of the recruiting process. And before someone gets all bent out of shape, Sheila actually calls the shots most of the time since she manages the cash. </p>

      <h3>Sheila</h3>
      <p>If Anthony is the old man and captain of the ship, then I guess I must be the semi-old, co-captain. I love traveling with the beach always being my first choice of destinations. I keep saying that once the kids are gone, we might actually have money to get a little bungalow on the beach somewhere. I love watching our kids grow and develop not just in their respective sports but more importantly in the classroom and life skills. My "tribe" of best friends keeps me grounded and provides me with opportunities for stress relief and laughter. I absolutely love our crazy life and wouldn't have it any other way. </p>

      <h3>McKenna</h3>
      <p>Three words that describe me are independent, smart, and driven. I am the oldest of the kids. My favorite things to do are watching crime shows, hang out with my friends, and exercise. I am a retired collegiate athlete who recently stepped away from the game after playing softball for 15 years. I recently transferred to Ohio State where I plan to major in Psychology with a minor in sociology and education. I take my academics very seriously and in my opinion, I am the smartest of the three kids. I am excited to move out on my own this summer. If you want to give me a house warming gift...I won't say no.</p>

      <h3>Kaden</h3>
      <p>I am the middle child and the only boy...obviously. If I had to describe myself in three words, they would be gentleman, funny, and active. I enjoy waching YouTube videos, whipping people in Madden on my PS4, hanging out with my bros, and playing the sports I love. I never miss a workout and work constantly to perfect the little things that will set me apart from other football and baseball players. My favorite subjects in school are math and science. I think I am the funniest of the three kids. Oh...I recently started a job and can say that making money that I can spend however I want is awesome.</p>

      <h3>Marissa</h3>
      <p>I am the baby of the family who loves to hurdle and hang out with my small circle of friends. Hurdle lessons and lifting keeps me busy throughout the year. I was a gymnast growing up and competed in meets as far away as Arizona and the Bahamas. This started my love for travel and one of my favorite things to do is going to the beach with my best friend, Camden. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and Facetiming with my friends since I can't see them right now. My favorite subject in school is biology. If I had to describe myself in three words they would be awkward, nice, and athletic.</p>

      <h3>Arya</h3>
      <p>Arya is named after my favorite female character from the HBO series, Game of Thrones. She is a miniature Aussiedoodle that we got from Premier Pups in Johnstown, OH on August 30, 2017. Arya will chase a ball as long as someone is willing to throw it so if you see her at a ballfield...you've been warned. She also likes to play at being a fake guard dog and barks everytime the garage door opens, there is a knock on the door, or she sees someone new in the house. Finally, Arya thinks that she is part cat as she spends a good portion of the day laying on top of the couch looking out the front window.</p>
